1. The 3 iteration constructs are, (for) loop, (do while) loop and (while) loop.
In this workshop, I used for loop to construct a temperature recorder and while loop to analyze and validate the temperature

2. In a do while loop, the condition is evaluated first.
However in a do while loop, the condition is not evaluated until the end of the loop.
A do while loop will also always run at least once.


3. Conditional expression evaluates the conditions given.
If true, it will chose the first option. If false, it will chose other option.
