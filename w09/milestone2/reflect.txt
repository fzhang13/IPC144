1) Functions in C is are groups of statements when put together, can perform a task and then return control to the caller.
Functions are needed because it supports modular design and cohesion which helps us reduce bugs. Functions also allows us to call 
on them when we needed to avoid repeated code writing and to improve our efficiency.

2) The "helper" functions is not included in the "contacts" module because its objective is inherently different from the contacts module.
It serves as condition check for the program, where as "contacts" module serves as an input program. if the two were to be together. The code would
be really long and confusing, which allows for errors to occur. By seperating them we are able to efficiently call on them when we need a conditions to be checked.
