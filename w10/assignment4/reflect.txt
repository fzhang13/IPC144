3. findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone allows us to find the exact location/position of the data inside the array for us to easily access to update and maintenance it. Instead of contantly adding, we can find the specific contact by using these functions, then we can go in and update/delete as needed. getTenDigitPhone also allows us to validate the data input of phone numbers and make sure it is the correct format (exactly 10 digit). This allows us to ignore entries that does not meet the 10 digit requirement.

4.By using more functions, or calling a function inside another functions. I learned that through this method, we improve readability of the code and allows us to better streamline the code. This also help locate the problem easier because the error is located within a specific function, thus allowing for easy maintenance if there was a error with the code. This is the core concept of a modular design
